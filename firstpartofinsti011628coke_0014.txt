The Prfface.

This pai-t wee haue (and not without president ) publishecl in
English, for that they ate an introduaion to the knowledge
of the nationall Lawes of the Realme 5 a worke necessarie,
and yet heetetofore not vndertakcn by any ‚ albeit in all other
profeffions there are the like. We haue left out Author to speake
his owne language, and haue transsated him into English , to the
end that any of the Nobilitie,0r Gentrie os this R ealme,or of any
Other estate‚or profeffion whatsoeuer‚that will be pleasedto read
him and these Institutes , may vnderstand the language whetein
they are written.

I cannot coniceture that the generali communicating of these
Lawes in the English tongue can worke any inconuenience,but in-
troduce great profit,seeing that Ignorantia iuria non excuſsat, Igno-
rance of the Law excuseth not.

And eerein 1 am iustified by the Wisedome of a Parliament

· the wor s whereos be, ‘T hat the Lames and Customes eff this Realme

the rather should bec reasbnably perceiuedandknowne , and better vn-
derftood by the tangue vsedin this Realme, and by so mach euery man

uin aegiosss’and bountries where the Kfng ‚ εἰσ NoslesJandother'o'thf}
fiydRealme haue beene, good gomnance and full raght is done to eum’e
man, because that the Lawesand Customes bce learned and vse‘d in the
Tongqe of the countrey ε as more at large by the said Ast‚and the

, putuiew thereofmay appeare,Et neminem opertet effi sapientiorem

Legibus , No man ought to bec wiser than the LaW.

And true it is that our ssookes of Reports and statutes in aunti-
ent times were written in such French‚as in those times was com·
monly spoken and written by the French themselues . But this
kind of French that out Author haue vsed is most commonly
written and read, and very rarely spoken,and therefore cannot be
either pure‚or well pronounced . Yet the change thereof( hauing
beene so long accustomed ) should bee without any profit,but not
without great danger and difficulrie ε For so many antient Termes
and Words drawne from that legall French , are growne to bee
vocabula artis,Vocables of Art, s 0 apt and fignificant to expresse
‘the true sence of the Laws‚and ate so wouen into the Laws them-
selues ‚ as it is in a manner impoffibleto change ‘them , neither
ought legall Termes to be changed.
