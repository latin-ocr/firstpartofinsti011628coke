good pleading he highly in this Worke commended to his sonne,

Lawyer(1 mean)Logicke‚as you {hal perceiue by reading oi these
Institutes,wherein are obserued his Sillogismcsfinductions, ‚ and

when a great learned mam-who is long in making) dyeth> much
learning dyeth with him.

That which we hauc formerly written , that this Booke is the
ornament of the Common Law ‚ and the most perfect and abso-
lute Worke that cuer was written in any humane Science ε and
in another place ‚ that which 1 affirmed and tooke vpon mee to

’ maintaine against all oppofites whatsoeuer , that it is a Worke of

as absolute perfectiori in his kind, and as free from errour, as any

Bookc that 1 haue knowne to be written of any humane learning,
{hall to the diligent and obseruing Reader of these Instituta, be
made manifest,and we by them (which is but a Commentary vp-

stood our Author, but concur-red with me in his commendation.

Habet enim iustam venerationem quitquid excellit , For whatsoeuer

Labour3‚they may know the truth and be conuerted. But herein

wee will proceede no further. For Stultum est abfivrdaa opiniones

accuratius refiffere, It is meere folly to confute absurd opinions

with too much curiofitie.

And albeit, our Author in his three Bookes cites not many Au-

and approoued by these two faithfull witneffes in matter of Law,
Authoriry,and Reason. Certaine it is, when he raiseth any que-
stion‚and ffieweth the reason on both fides , the latter opinion is

his owne‚ andis consonant to Law. Wee haue knowne many kof
