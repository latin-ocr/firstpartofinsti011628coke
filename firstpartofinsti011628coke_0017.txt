The Prefitce.

And when the Reader {hall in any part of 'this Worke finde

no perse& sence, or the case apparantly against Law , or mis-
quotations ‚ or incongrue Laryne, or falleOrthographie, or
the like 3 Ι shall defire ol him three things:

first, Before hee enter (vpon the first apprehenfion there-2
of ) into any euill concert ‚ That hee would aduisedly peruse
ouer the Errata in the end of this Booke, & corre& his booke
accordingly, and thenI am persuaded he shall in many things
teceiue satisfaffion.

Secondly, That he will impure no more or greater laults to
the Printer, than he deserues, in respe& Iwas in the C ountrey
during all the time of the impreffion hereol, and for that hee
might eafily mistake my hand writing, beeing in many placen
not easse to be read but by him that was well acquainted there-
with : and the rather, because the Errata be not such, (sauing a
verie few) but that the iudicious Reader vpon the Context
and other parts of this Worke , will eafily vnderstand my
messhlffily, That the learned Reader will not conceiue any
opinion against any part of this painefull and large Volume‚

vntill he shal haue aduisedly read ouer the whole, and diligen&- ἴ
ly searched outand well confidered of the seuerall Authori- ‘⁰

ties, Proo fes ‚ and Reasons which wee haue cited and set
downe for warrant and confirmation of our opinions through-
out ‘this whole Worke.

Myne aduice to the Studient is , Tha't before hee read any
part of out Commentaries vpon any Sefflon ‚ that first hee
read againe and againe our Authour himselfe in that Sefflon,
and doe his best endeauours ‚ first of himselfe , and then
by conference with others , (whichis the life of Studie) to
vnderstand it‚and then ‘to read our Commentarie thereupon,
and no more at any one rimenham hee is able with delight to
beare away, and after to meditate thereon,which is the life of
reading. But of this Argument we haue lor the better directi-
on of our Studient in his Studie ‚ spoken in our Epistle to our
first Booke of Reports.

And albeit the Reader {hall not atany one day (doe what he

can) reach to the meaning of our Author‚ or of our commem
' taries,
