‘The ‘Prefhcel

Ancestors to Sir William Littleton her sonna

This worke was not publiffled in Print , either by our Authot ,
himselfe,or Richard his ronne‚or any other, vntill after the decea- fflffiffifff‘k‘
ses both or our Author,and of richard his sonne. For 1 find it not
cited in any Booke or Reporc, before Sir Anebmy Fitzberbm cia
ted him in his Ἅρπινα breuium 3 who publilhed that Booke ofhis
Quem Breuium in 2 6.H.8 . Which worke of our Author in re· F›N·⁸· ”20⁶¹
⁸ sperit of the excellencie thereof (by all probabilitie) should haue
bin cited in the Reports of the raignes of 225 . R.3.H.7.0r H.8.0t
by S. Iermyn in his booke of the Do<stor and Studient (which he
published in the three δε twentieth yere of H .8.) if in those dayes
our Aut hors Booke had bin printed. And yet you shall obscrue, mre.
that time doth euer giue greater authoritic to Workes and
Writings‚that are of great and prolound learning‚than at the first
they had. The first impreffion that I find of our Aurhors Booke WhenthiJWorkewar
was at Roane in France, by William le Tailier (for that it was writ- Μ ¹²¹¹P‘¹¹¹“‘¹·
ten in Ptench) Ad instantiam Richardi pinsita, at the instance of Ri-
chardl’t'nfin the Printer of King H. 8 . before the said Booke of
Natura Breuium was published3& therefore vpon these and other
things‚that we haue sccn,we are of opinion‚that it was first printed
about the fourc and twentiethyeare of the raigne of King H.8.
fince which time he hath beene commonly cited , and (as he de·-
serues)more and more highly esteemed„ ·

Hee that is defirous to see· his pidum, may in the Churches of Histiaum
Frankley & Hales Owen see the graue and reuerend countenance
of our Author,the outwatd man,but hee hath left this Booke, as a ι
figure of that higher and nobler part (thatis) of the excellent and ἶίξξξμῑξ of ¹¹¹³ ,
rate endowments of his minde‚cspecially in the profound know· ’ ’
ledge of the fundamentall Laws of this Realm.He that diligently
reads this his excellent Worke‚shall behold the child & figure of
his mind, which the more often he beholds inthe vifiall line,and
well ob semes him,the more {hall he iustly admire the iudgement
of our Author,and increase his owne.This only is defired‚that he
had written of other parts of the Law‚and specially ol the rules of
oood pleading ( the beart-string of the common Law) wherein
lie ςὶὲςίιὶὶεά, for of him might the saying of our Engliffi Poet be came&
